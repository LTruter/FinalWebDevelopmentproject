# Final Web Development project

<h2> Description: </h2>
My Final Web Development project for EDUVOS was to create a system that would replace the manual book recordings for their products they receive from suppliers.
<br>
<br>
So I created a system that is used to record products. Users enter details for each product, which are then stored in an XML document. After the XML document is created, the products within it are displayed. To ensure the XML document is correctly formatted, there is an option to validate its authenticity. Once authenticated, the data from the XML document is stored in a MySQL database named 'products'.

*Please refer to my documentation for more information.
